# Week 8

## Tasks for the Week:

 - [ ] finish producing an accurate plot for **truth match fraction**.
 - [ ] learn about reconstruction efficiency & selection efficiency & ROOT.
 - [ ] produce TEfficiency plots for reco & selection efficiency.

## Tutorials:

 - we have set up [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/primer/ROOTPrimer.pdf) (recommended to go through the tutorial step by step) for jupyter lab by entering `source root/bin/thisroot.sh` before starting the Jupyter Lab.
 - we will use [TEfficiency](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTEfficiency.html) function for the graphing. Please finish the **third** example "Filling with Events". 
 - The code is written in C++, to translate into python:
 ``` python
import ROOT 

# Set up a new canvas
c1 = ROOT.TCanvas("example","",600,400)
c1.SetFillStyle(1001)
c1.SetFillColor(kWhite)


# create one-dimensional TEfficiency object with fixed bin size 
pEff = ROOT.TEfficiency("eff","my efficiency;x;#epsilon",20,0,10)
rand3 = ROOT.TRandom3()

for i in range(10000):
    #simulate events with variable under investigation
    x = rand3.Uniform(10)
    # check selection: bPassed = DoesEventPassSelection(x)
    bPassed = rand3.Rndm() < ROOT.TMath.Gaus(x,5,4)
    pEff.Fill(bPassed,x)
    
pEff.Draw()
c1.Draw()
```

## Reconstruction Efficiency

 - To successfully reconstruct a Hard Scatter vertex, one test is done: `|reco(max(number of associated tracks)) - truth_HS| < 0.1 mm`
   - or in words, reconstruction condition: the distance between the reconstructed vertex with the maximum number of associated tracks (same as hard scatter truth vertex) and the hard scatter truth vertex is less than 0.1 mm. 
 - Similar to the code above, `pEff.Fill(bPassed,x)`, the code will be `TEff.Fill([reconstruction condition], localPUDensity)`
 
#### LocalPUDensity 

 - local pile-up density near a vertex, defined as the number of generated vertices per unit length within a symmetrical ±2 mm longitudinal window
 - You loop around the vertices and find each difference, and for those are less than 2, count tht total in one event, hence the local PU Density.
 
## Selection Efficiency
 - To successfully select a Hard Scatter vertex, one test is done: `Reconstructed Vertex with max(PT^2) = [max(number of associated tracks) - HS <= 0.1]` (should be self-explanatory) 
   - Side notes: ATLAS definition - the reconstructed vertex with highest pT2 is the one containing the largest total weight from true HS tracks.
   - BUT we don't have a truth track weight output, so we have to base on Athena definition for this one.
  
 - And of course, `TEff.Fill([selection condition], localPUDensity)`
